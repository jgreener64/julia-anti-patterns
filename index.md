title: A collection of Julia anti-patterns
---

Learning what to do in Julia by learning what not to do in Julia.

[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a modern, powerful programming language gaining in popularity. Like any language it has unique and appealing features, but also pitfalls and gotchas. Users coming from higher-level languages such as Python or R may in particular struggle and fall for one of these errors.

This collection of worst practices will hopefully act as a reference and give you some of the tools you need to be writing lightning fast, error-free, maintainable Julia code. Parts are heavily influenced by the Julia manual - particularly [Performance Tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/performance-tips) and [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/style-guide) - but take a slightly more informal and opinionated tone. This whole site was influenced by [The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/index.html).
